  we found more complete version of the domain mapping. Through DNS, it can relays to 2 different website, either ns1.bodis.com or ns2.bodis.com. Those 2 website points to different IP address.

    why this is interesting:
      - When we try to search for ntust website (ntust.edu.tw), we can find ntust's website
      - However, when we try to search for university in taiwan specifically in taipei city, the result is unexpected because not a single university is mentioned but previously ntust website is there. 
        The result mentioned about tenten university (Indie Hackers) and Wenzao Ursuline University which is not as we expected to see.
      - Then, we still haven't given up, we try search for university in taiwan, most of the result is the university in hsinchu like the NTHU.

Curiosity about our researches : |
  We have heard some people said that bitcoin's value will raise and the peak will be on February next year, that's why we are curious about bitcoin tight now, and the topic we found is "Will people ever get tired of trading bitcoin?". 
  Based on the forum, they said that it's depend on the people's interest. 
  The second topic is "Why bitcoin price drops and surges unexpectedly", the forum said that it is because of the fake news and rumors.

Interresting hacks  : |
  1. To bypass the ruby version (compatibility problem due to a version that is too recent)
    - Delete the "s" at the end of "exists" in space_finder.rb (if !File.exists? filename)
    - Copy this code in the module URI :
        def escape(str)
              alpha = "a-zA-Z"
              alnum = "#{alpha}\\d"
              unreserved = "\\-_.!~*'()#{alnum}"
              reserved = ";/?:@&=+$,\\[\\]"
              unsafe = Regexp.new("[^#{unreserved}#{reserved}]")
              str.gsub(unsafe) do
                  us = $&
                  tmp = ''
                  us.each_byte do |uc|
                      tmp << sprintf('%%%02X', uc)
                  end
                  tmp
              end.force_encoding(Encoding::US_ASCII)
          end
      - Edit the wordlist.txt with one word in this list : https://github.com/koaj/aws-s3-bucket-wordlist/blob/master/list.txt
      - Run ./space_finder.rb -v wordlist.txt
