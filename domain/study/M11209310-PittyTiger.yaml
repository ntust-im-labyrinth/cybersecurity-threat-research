  DIG (Domain Name System) is base on LINUX, 
  but for study can just use on https://www.diggui.com/ for website GUI.
  At most time, its for DNS troubleshooting tool getting some info for domain.
  On WIN systems can use nslookup for substitute. 

  For last APT-12 Pitty Tiger, we've found that 
    (1) avstore.com.tw
    (2) sophos.skypetm.com.tw
    (3) symantecs.com.tw
    (4) trendmicro.org.tw
  seems to be closed. 

  So we tried remove .tw looking for some info
    (1) avstore.com -> this seems no threat 
      ANSWER SECTION ->
      avstore.com.		600	IN	A	15.197.142.173
      avstore.com.		600	IN	A	3.33.152.147
    (3) symantecs.com -> really strangeeeee, IP at US.

  Its a search engine for searching internet-connected devices and system.
  Focus on getting system's infornation, include what protocal, which openport and who own the IP.
  I've used it on searching exposed PLC device which produce by Omron, 
  but after doing some try out ... I gess most of them are HoneyPot.
