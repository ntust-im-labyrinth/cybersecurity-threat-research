  DIG (Domain Name System) is base on LINUX, 
  but for study can just use on https://www.diggui.com/ for website GUI.
  At most time, its for DNS troubleshooting tool getting some info for domain.
  On WIN systems can use nslookup for substitute.

  Focus on getting system's infornation, include what protocal, which openport and who own the IP.
