    Charming Kitten targeted a number of individuals associated with the U.S. aerospace industry, including personnel at Boeing,
    Raytheon, and TASC. The group used spearphishing emails containing malicious attachments to gain initial access to victims.
    The emails were spoofed to appear as if they were sent from Boeing and contained a malicious attachment that, when opened,
    installed a backdoor on the victim’s machine. The backdoor was used to collect information from the victim’s machine and
    send it to a command and control (C2) server. The C2 server was also used to send commands to the backdoor, including commands
    to download and execute additional malware. The group also used a compromised email account to send spearphishing emails to
    other individuals associated with the aerospace industry. The emails contained a malicious link that, when clicked,
    redirected the victim to a website that hosted a malicious file. The file, when opened, installed a backdoor on the victim’s machine.

    Charming Kitten targeted a number of individuals associated with the Trump administration. The group used spearphishing emails
    containing malicious attachments to gain initial access to victims. The emails were spoofed to appear as if they were sent from
    the University of Cambridge and contained a malicious attachment that, when opened, installed a backdoor on the victim’s machine.
    The backdoor was used to collect information from the victim’s machine and send it to a C2 server. The C2 server was also used
    to send commands to the backdoor, including commands to download and execute additional malware.

    Between August and September 2019, Charming Kitten, a suspected Iranian hacking group, made 2,700 attempts to access targeted email accounts,
    resulting in 241 attacks and 4 compromised accounts, according to Microsoft.
    While the targets were linked to a United States presidential campaign, no election-related accounts were compromised.
    Although Microsoft did not specify the campaign, Reuters later suggested it was Donald Trump's re-election campaign due to its use of Microsoft Outlook.
    Iran denied involvement in election meddling, but cybersecurity experts, including Microsoft and ClearSky Cyber Security,
    maintained Charming Kitten's involvement, citing victim profiles, time overlap, and consistent attack methods as evidence.

  No, we do not know the real identity of the members of Charming Kitten. Attribution of cyber threat actors is often difficult and contested.
  There is no single, definitive source of attribution, and different organizations may use different names for the same group.
  In the case of Charming Kitten, there is a consensus among many experts that the group is likely based in Iran.
  However, there is no concrete evidence to prove this, and the group could be operating from another country.
