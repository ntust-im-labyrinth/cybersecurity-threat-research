- French Officials Detail 'Fancy Bear' Hack of TV5Monde
  date: 2017

  The incident response team involved in the investigation concluded that the attackers first targeted TV5Monde on Jan. 23, 2015, and accessed a server used by the broadcaster. "One of [the] TV5Monde multimedia servers - used by journalists to send content back - had its RDP port exposed to [the] internet and was using [a] default username/password," French incident response expert Matt Suiche, managing director at Dubai-based Comae Technologies, says in an English-language overview of the French-language ANSSI presentation. "But this machine was not connected to the internal network, and was quickly classified as [a] dead-end by the attacker."Later, however, attackers returned, using a compromised third-party account that allowed them to connect to the TV5Monde VPN, beginning Feb. 6, investigators found.After that, attackers began scanning internal machines connected to an infected endpoint and identified two internal Windows systems that that were used to manage cameras. The attacker then used one of these compromised systems to create a new administrator-level user in Active Director called "LocalAdministator," on Feb. 11, 2015.The incident response team said this was the first major clue they uncovered about the investigation, saying that it jumped out because all of Active Directory administrator names had been in French.During the reconnaissance phase of the 2015 attack - from Feb. 16 to March 25 - the attackers mapped the network's IT infrastructure, including searching for various strings - "telnet," "ssh," "video," "compte" [account], "pass," "VPN - and collecting as much related information as possible, including from the IT department's internal wiki, which detailed how login and password was handled, Suiche says.After that, "the attacker compromised another administrator machine - codenamed: ANKOU - which contains the Remote Access Control (RAT) which was used for the sabotage."The sabotage consisted of running "destructive commands" - obtained via TACACS logs - that erased switch and router firmware, resulting in black screens for viewers, "except for one new channel that was launched on the same day which was covering the attack from inside," Suiche says.

- Russia's 'Fancy Bear' APT Targets Ukrainian Energy Facility
  date: 2023

  Ukraine's Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-UA) detected and explored the attack, it noted in a report. CERT-UA stated that the MO of the group was to use bulk phishing emails from a fake address that linked to a .ZIP archive, so that it could ultimately gain access to the organization's system and data.The email CERT-UA shared included a message that read: "Hi! I talked to three girls, and they agreed. Their photos are in the archive; I suggest checking them out on the website." This is notably different from past malicious emails that Russian hackers have used, where the correspondence has included false government documents or illegitimate software updates. The recent email also included a BAT formatted file that would have executed harmful script once opened.In addition to this, researchers noted that the attackers installed Tor onto the victim's computer, allowing for anonymous Internet browsing and difficulty tracing the data's root source.
