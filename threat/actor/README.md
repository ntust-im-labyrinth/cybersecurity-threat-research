U.S. intelligence agencies have accused APT28 of hacking into the Democratic National Committee (DNC) servers and releasing sensitive documents through platforms like WikiLeaks, with the goal of influencing the election.

For instance, they were suspected of being involved in attacks on the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea. These attacks disrupted the Games' IT infrastructure and were seen as retaliatory measures against South Korea. "}] | Attribution in the world of cyber espionage is challenging, but several factors have led cybersecurity experts and intelligence agencies to attribute APT28 to Russia and the GRU: Technical similarities in malware and infrastructure used by APT28 and other Russian-backed APT groups. The group's consistent focus on Russian strategic interests. Analysis of the group's tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) by various cybersecurity firms and government agencies. Information from insider sources and defectors. | [{'Cybersecurity companies': "Many cybersecurity firms closely track APT28's activities and share threat intelligence."}, {'Government agencies': "Intelligence agencies such as the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and the UK's National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) have analyzed APT28's actions."}, {'Open-source reporting': "News outlets and research organizations often report on APT28's activities based on public information and expert analysis."}, {'Insider sources': 'In some cases, defectors or individuals with knowledge of Russian intelligence operations have provided valuable insights.'}] |
