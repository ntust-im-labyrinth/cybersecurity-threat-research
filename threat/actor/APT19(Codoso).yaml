Mar 2013	Breach of the US Department of Labor website
On April 30, 2013, CrowdStrike was alerted to a strategic web compromise on a US Department of Labor website that was redirecting visitors to an attacker’s infrastructure. Eight other compromised sites were also reported to be similarly compromised with the data suggesting that this campaign began in mid-March.

Early 2014	Breaches of National Security Think Tanks
This actor, who was engaged in targeting and collection of Southeast Asia policy information, suddenly began targeting individuals with a tie to Iraq/Middle East issues. This is undoubtedly related to the recent Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIS) takeover of major parts of Iraq and the potential disruption for major Chinese oil interests in that country. In fact, Iraq happens to be the fifth-largest source of crude oil imports for China and the country is the largest foreign investor in Iraq’s oil sector.

Mar 2014	Breach of the US Office of Personnel Management
OPM investigates a breach of its computer networks dating back to March 2014. Authorities trace the intrusion to China. OPM offers employees free credit monitoring and assures employees that no personal data appears to have been stolen.

Mar 2014	Breach of USIS
It emerges that USIS, a background check provider for the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, was hacked. USIS offers 27,000 DHS employees credit monitoring through AllClearID (full disclosure: AllClear is an advertiser on this blog). Investigators say Chinese are hackers responsible, and that the attackers broke in by exploiting a vulnerability in an enterprise management software product from SAP.

This campaign infected victims with Sakula malware variants that were signed with stolen certificates.

Apr 2015	Operation “Kingslayer”
RSA Research investigated the source of suspicious, observed beaconing thought to be associated with targeted malware. In the course of this tac-tical hunt for unidentified code, RSA discovered a sophisticated attack on a software supply-chain involving a Trojan inserted in otherwise legitimate software; software that is typically used by enterprise system administrators.

May 2015	Breach of health insurance company Premera Blue Cross

May 2015	Breach of health insurance company Carefirst Blue Cross
CareFirst BlueCross BlueShield on Wednesday said it had been hit with a data breach that compromised the personal information on approximately 1.1 million customers. There are indications that the same attack methods may have been used in this intrusion as with breaches at Anthem and Premera, incidents that collectively involved data on more than 90 million Americans.

May 2017	Phishing campaign targeting at least seven global law and investment firms.
In early May, the phishing lures leveraged RTF attachments that exploited the Microsoft Windows vulnerability described in CVE 2017-0199. Toward the end of May, APT19 switched to using macro-enabled Microsoft Excel (XLSM) documents. In the most recent versions, APT19 added an application whitelisting bypass to the XLSM documents. At least one observed phishing lure delivered a Cobalt Strike payload.
