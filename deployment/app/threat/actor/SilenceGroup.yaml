  The Developer is a qualified reverse engineer. His advanced reverse-engineering skills do not prevent him from making mistakes while programming. 
  He is responsible for developing tools for conducting attacks and is also able to modify complex exploits and third party software. 
  That said, he patched a little known Trojan that had not previously been employed by other groups. 
  In addition, the Developer has sufficient knowledge of ATM processes, systems and has access to non-public malware samples, which are usually only available to security companies.
  A distinctive feature of Silence is their untypical role structure and small size. It appears, this Russian-speaking group includes only two members.
